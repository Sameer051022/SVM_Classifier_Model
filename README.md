# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

This Jupyter notebook delves into the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, focusing on its application in both binary and multi-class classification problems. It includes detailed steps for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Overview
SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification due to its ability to handle both linear and non-linear boundaries. This notebook provides a comprehensive guide on how to effectively deploy SVM in classification tasks, emphasizing the importance of kernel choice and parameter tuning.

## Key Features
- Thorough data preprocessing to optimize model input
- Implementation of SVM using sklearn with various kernel functions
- Hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance
- Detailed evaluation of model results using confusion matrix, precision-recall metrics, and ROC curves
- Visualization of decision boundaries and support vectors

## Libraries Used
- pandas and numpy for data handling
- sklearn for SVM implementation and metrics
- matplotlib and seaborn for creating informative visualizations

## Usage
This notebook is designed for educational purposes, catering to both beginners and advanced users who are interested in understanding or enhancing their skills in SVM classifiers. It serves as a practical reference for deploying SVM in various scenarios.

## Contributions
We encourage users to contribute by providing feedback, suggesting improvements, or by extending the notebook with additional kernel methods or more sophisticated datasets.
